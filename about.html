            <p>
                I hail from the culturally rich city of Kolkata, India, where my passion for learning has always been a driving force.<br><br>
                
                Currently, I am immersed in the world of academics at Adamas University, where I am diligently pursuing a Bachelor of Computer Applications (BCA) degree.<br><br>
                
                My academic journey is complemented by a diverse array of hobbies that keep me engaged and balanced. I find immense joy in playing various musical instruments, which allows me to express my creativity. Trekking offers me a way to connect with nature and challenge myself physically, while gaming provides a fun and competitive outlet. Additionally, my interest in video editing allows me to blend technology with storytelling, creating compelling visual content.<br><br>
                
                Professionally, I have had the privilege of working in the corporate field for nearly five years, primarily in media productions. I currently serve as the Lead Post-Production Manager at a renowned wedding company, where I oversee the entire post-production process, ensuring high-quality outcomes. My experience also extends to freelancing, where I have honed my skills and delivered projects across various domains.<br><br>
                
                Building this website is a testament to my continuous pursuit of knowledge and my commitment to staying ahead in the digital age. It marks another milestone in my career, one that I believe will significantly enhance my professional profile and open new avenues for growth.
